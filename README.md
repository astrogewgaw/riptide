### Overview

__riptide__ is an end-to-end pulsar searching package implementing the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA). Its interface is entirely in python while the core algorithms are implemented in C. It is being developed with ease of use in mind, without sacrificing execution speed. The main features are:

- Reading time series data written by major pulsar software packages such as PRESTO and SIGPROC
- Saving / Loading data products to / from HDF5
- Carry metadata in a flexible format across pipeline stages and into HDF5 outputs.
- Make nice plots of everything

### The name

riptide loosely stands for "seaRchIng for Pulsars in the TIme Domain". Mostly because there are no cool names containing the letters "FFA". Also a subtle reference to Australia where I did my Masters.
