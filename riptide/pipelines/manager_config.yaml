##### Paths to configuration files for the searches
# NOTE: they must be placed in the same directory as this file.

##### Harmonic filtering
# See the flag_harmonics() function docstring for an explanation
# 'enabled' can be True or False. False means that no removal of harmonic 
# candidates is attempted.

##### Candidate filtering
# The cap on candidate number is applied last, after all the other filters
# These fields can be left empty, in which case the corresponding filter is
# not applied
